# EXPENSE TRACKER

> What will the application do?

The application will keep track of the user's cash inflow and outflow in daily life. 
This could help users to set goals in amount of expense over a period of time.
As well as to let users know how much they spend on each category in that period.

> Who will use it?

Pretty much everyone who wish to keep track of their own expense. 
Spending money is inevitable in everyone's daily life. Yet, not everyone 
is so lucky to be rich and **have unlimited amount of money to spend.**
Therefore, many people will have to keep track of their money spent.

> Why is this project of interest to you?   

Since I started college, I started to take up the responsibility to pay for 
my daily expenses. Yet, **living in Vancouver in 2023 is expensive.**
Although I have a part-time job, I realize it is still easy to overspend. So, I wanted to
have a tool to help me to keep track of my expenses. Besides, since I am 
living with **5 roommates**, I realize that it is problematic to spilt money 
when we refill groceries. So, I think being able to track group expense 
would be a helpful function as well.
