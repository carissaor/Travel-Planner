# TRIP PLANNER

> What will the application do?

The application will enable users to add destinations they want to visit in the future.
Under each destination, there will be a budget, a wishlist and an itinerary. 
The wishlist will include all information researched by the user including cost and descriptions for 
restaurant, activities, transportation etc. Then user can click on it and add that to 
the itinerary as long as the total cost is within the budget. 

> Who will use it?

Anyone who would love to travel. International travelling is pretty costly, 
including plane ticket, hotels, and all other expenses. So, keeping track of the expense
and at the same time planning the trip would be helpful to users.

> Why is this project of interest to you?   

As we enter the post-pandemic era, many countries lifted their travel restrictions,
it is more possible for us to travel compared to 2-3 years ago. I like travelling a lot. 
But, it is sometimes hard to plan for the itinerary especially when I have limited budget.
