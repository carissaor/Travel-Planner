# TRIP PLANNER

> What will the application do?

The application will enable users to add destinations they wish to visit in the future.
Under each destination, there will be a budget, a wishlist and an itinerary. 
The wishlist will include information researched by the user including cost and information for 
food, activities and accommodation etc. User will be able to add that information to 
the itinerary as long as the total cost stays within the budget. 

> Who will use it?

Anyone who loves to travel can use the application.
With the cost of plane ticket, hotels, and all other expenses associated with international travel, 
it would be helpful for users to keep track of their estimated expense and plan their trips accordingly. 

> Why is this project of interest to you?   

As we enter the post-pandemic era, many countries lift their travel restrictions,
it is more possible for us to travel compared to 2-3 years ago. As someone who loves to travel,
I often find it challenging to plan my itinerary according to my budget and duration of stay because
I am often overwhelmed by the amount of information about a place found on the internet. 
Therefore, a trip planner sounds like an interesting and useful tool to me.
